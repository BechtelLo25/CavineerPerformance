    <h3 class="robotdescription">During this competition the Cavineer's robot Bruce was challenged to deliver gears to an airship and shooting fuel (wiffle balls) into a boiler to generate steam pressure. At the end of the match, robots could climb aboard the airship to prepare for
        "takeoff," earning additional points. The game was played on a field with various obstacles and challenges, requiring robots to navigate and interact with game elements strategically.
