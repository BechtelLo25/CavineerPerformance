    <h3 class="robotdescription">During this competition our robot Jankins was challenged to shoot balls in two hoops of varying heights. The robot was also challenged with picking these pieces up from the human player as well as picking pieces up off the ground, both were successfully
        achieved. At the end of every match jankins had to climbs on rungs of 4 varying heights, the higher the rung the more points it is worth. This robot consists of an shooter for launching the balls into the hoops, an intake for picking up balls,
        a climber for climbing, and a tank drive.
