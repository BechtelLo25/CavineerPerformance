    <h3 class="robotdescription">During this competition the Cavineer's robot Fahrenheit was challenged to place boxes in various locations to gain points, the main one being the balance in the center of the field. Fahrenheit consisted of an intake that served the purpose of taking
        in and shooting out game pieces. This intake was connected to an elevator the Fahrenheit used to place the pieces at varying heights.
