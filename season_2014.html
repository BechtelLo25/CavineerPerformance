    <h3 class="robotdescription">During this competition the Cavineer's robot Kevin was challenged to pass a large exercise ball back and forth while maneuvering around defense robots and scoring goals in high or low goals at the ends of the field. The game also included a co-opertition
        aspect, where both alliances could work together to score additional points. The game was played on a field with various obstacles and challenges, such as trusses, goals, and defense zones, which robots had to navigate and interact with strategically.
