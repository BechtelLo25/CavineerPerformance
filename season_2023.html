    <h2 class="robottext">Robot</h2>
    <h3 class="robotdescription">During this competition our robot Kelvin was challenged to place cones and cubes on pegs and shelves of varying heights. The robot was also challenged with picking these pieces up from the human player as well as picking pieces up off the ground,
        both were successfully achieved. At the end of every match kelvin had to balance on a platform called the charge station. This robot consists of an arm and claw for grabbing and placing, an intake to put cubes on the bottom nodes fast, and a swerve
        drive for fast maneuvering.
