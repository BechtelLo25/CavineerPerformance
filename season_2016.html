    <h3 class="robotdescription">During this competition the Cavineer's robot Finnegan was challenged to capture the opposing alliance's tower by shooting boulders at it, and finally, climbing the tower to face the "boss" and capture it for extra points. The game was played on a
        field with various obstacles and challenges, such as drawbridges, moats, and portcullises, which robots had to cross strategically.
